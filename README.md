## Smart Water Tank(IOT)

A circuit is designed to determine the water level in the tank and provide detail of water level to users through android app. If the water reaches the top of the tank, then motor will automatically stop working. Similarly when the water level goes down from a decided level then a notification will be sent to user asking weather to start motor or not.
